Elasticsearch has made search more approachable by exposing Web friendly APIs (REST + JSON) that reduce the impedance mismatch associated with relational models, at no sacrifice to query capability. On the other side of the equation, AngularJS simplifies the effort required to build highly interactive, data-driven Web applications.

The goal was to write an application to load stackover flow data as ElasticSearch indices and invoking REST request using elasticsearchJS library from AngularJS and plot the searach results into inteactive data visualization using data visualization library d3.js.
